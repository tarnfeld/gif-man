Credit to [SkypeInlineImage](https://github.com/netpro2k/SkypeImageInline) for the original implementation. A love child born out\r\nof the need for INSTANT GIFS at [Duedil](http://github.com/duedil-ltd).\r\n\r\n## Getting started\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n\r\n- Xcode 4 (+ Command Line Tools)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Building / Installing\r\n\r\nYou'll need to build the project (both the bundle, and the skype style) before you can use it, there are various `make` targets to help with this. You can do everything by simply running the following;\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone git@github.com:tarnfeld/gif-man\r\ncd gif-man\r\nmake && make install\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Compilation**\r\n\r\nThe `make` command will clean up any existing build products, and re-build both the bundle and the chat style. You can run each of these actions seperately...\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nmake clean # Clean products\r\nmake clean-style # Clean out the chat style products\r\nmake clean-bundle #Â Clean out the bundle products\r\n\r\nmake build # Build all the products\r\nmake build-style # Build the chat style products\r\nmake build-bundle # Build the bundle products\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Installation**\r\n\r\nThe installation process will also attempt to install a working SIMBL agent if there isn't one already running. It will copy a working SIMBL agent into `~/Library/Application Support/SIMBL/SIMBLAgent.app` and also\r\ncreate a launch agent to make sure it's always running (after a reboot). If you don't want the make file to mess around with any of that, you can install the components seperately...\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nmake install # Verify / Install SIMBL, the bundle and the style\r\nmake install-style # Install the chat style\r\nmake install-bundle # Install the bundle\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Installing SIMBL**\r\n\r\nYou can also install SIMBL seperately if you like...\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nmake simbl\r\n```\r\n\r\n"}
